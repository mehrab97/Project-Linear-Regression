# Project-Linear-Regression
Diabetes dataset is one of the datasets available in sklearn. The diabetes dataset consists of 10 physiological variables (age, sex, weight, blood pressure) measure on 442 patients, and an indication of disease progression after one year.
In this project I have used Linear Regression(in scikit learn) as a training algorithm and submitted results predicted by that.

This project was done as a part of Data Science and Machine Learning course offered by Coding Ninjas.
